# Movie-Data_Analysis_and_Manipulation_Detection
The Movie Data Analysis and Manipulation Detection project aims to process and visualize data collected from various movie websites to make informed decisions regarding potential false manipulations. Reason for the project: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/


Goals:
- recreate events described in the reason article,
- make a suggestion if Fandango could have manipulated film ratings 2015
- make visual graphs that represent flow of conducted investigation
- create a simple report giving a possibility level for manipulated rating of the worst films between fandango and a platform that represents the lowest ratings


Guide:
- create venv,
- install libraries from the requirements.txt <pip install requirements.txt>,
- in folder "saved_graphs" we already have graphs by default, but it is possible to remove them, so they can be created again
- in the folder "report_ten_worst" we already have a report which gives the manipulation possibility for ten worst films presented in two platforms: Fandango and RottenTomatoes
- The report may be deleted, so it can be recreated again
- Follow comments in the graph_processor.py to understand steps


Final summary:
- The article might have a true core, Fandango might have manipulated its ratings
